CONTACT FORM SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Your contact form has been added to the website! To make it fully functional, you need to complete two quick setup steps:

STEP 1: Set up Formspree (handles email delivery)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Click "Get Started" and sign up for a FREE account (no credit card required)
3. Once logged in, click "New Form"
4. Give it a name like "Shakoor Capital Contact Form"
5. In the "Email" field, enter: was_shakoor@hotmail.com
6. Click "Create Form"
7. You'll see a form endpoint that looks like: https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123
8. Copy the full URL

9. Open index.html and find this line (around line 296):
   <form id="contactForm" class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">

10. Replace "YOUR_FORM_ID" with your actual form ID (just the part after /f/)
    Example: If your endpoint is https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123
    Change to: action="https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123"


STEP 2: Set up Google reCAPTCHA (spam protection)
-------------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
2. Log in with your Google account
3. Fill out the form:
   - Label: Shakoor Capital Contact Form
   - reCAPTCHA type: Select "reCAPTCHA v2" → "I'm not a robot" Checkbox
   - Domains: Add these domains:
     * shakoorcapital.com
     * timkempster.github.io
   - Accept the terms and click "Submit"

4. You'll see two keys:
   - Site Key (starts with 6L...)
   - Secret Key (keep this private)

5. Copy the SITE KEY

6. Open index.html and find this line (around line 313):
   <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY"></div>

7. Replace "YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY" with your actual site key
   Example: data-sitekey="6LcXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

8. In your Formspree dashboard, go to your form settings
9. Look for "Integrations" or "Spam Protection"
10. Add your reCAPTCHA SECRET KEY there


STEP 3: Test and Deploy
------------------------
1. Save the changes to index.html
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   cd C:\Users\timke\wassite
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure contact form with Formspree and reCAPTCHA"
   git push

3. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
4. Visit your website and test the contact form
5. You should receive test emails at was_shakoor@hotmail.com


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If form doesn't submit: Check browser console for errors (F12)
- If emails don't arrive: Check spam folder, verify email in Formspree settings
- If reCAPTCHA doesn't show: Verify the site key is correct and domain is added
- If you see "Please complete the reCAPTCHA": Make sure to check the reCAPTCHA box before submitting


FREE TIER LIMITS
----------------
- Formspree Free: 50 submissions/month (more than enough for most small businesses)
- reCAPTCHA: Unlimited and completely free

If you need more submissions, Formspree has affordable paid plans.
